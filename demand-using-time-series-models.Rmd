# Task Six: Findings and Conclusions

## 📌 Conclusion

Throughout this project, I worked with the `bike_sharing_daily` dataset, which records the daily count of bike rentals in Washington, D.C., along with various weather and seasonal features. The goal was to perform a thorough time series analysis and forecasting using ARIMA models.

### 🔍 Key Learnings:

-   I learned how to explore and visualize time series data using tools like `timetk`, and how to draw insights from patterns such as seasonality and trends.
-   I applied techniques like decomposition and differencing to make the data stationary, a crucial step for advanced modeling.
-   I used both manual ARIMA and auto ARIMA methods to model and forecast bike rental demand.
-   I evaluated the models based on residual patterns, AIC/BIC values, and forecast performance.

### ✅ Key Findings:

-   **Seasonality and Temperature**: Bike rentals were clearly influenced by seasonality and temperature — higher rentals were observed in warmer months.
-   **Strong Correlations**: Normalized temperature and feeling temperature showed a strong positive correlation with the number of rentals.
-   **Modeling Insights**: Auto ARIMA selected an optimal model based on AIC. Residuals passed the normality and randomness checks, indicating a good fit.
-   **Forecast**: The 25-day forecast provides a reasonable and interpretable estimate of future bike rental demand with confidence intervals.

### 📈 Takeaways:

-   Time series forecasting can be highly effective in understanding and predicting real-world patterns.
-   Cleaning the data and ensuring stationarity are essential for accurate ARIMA modeling.
-   Interactive visualizations and seasonal diagnostics are powerful tools for interpreting data behavior over time.

This project gave me hands-on experience with the full cycle of time series analysis — from data loading and cleaning, through modeling and diagnostics, to forecasting and interpretation.
